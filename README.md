# Web Dev Resources Website 

[Website](https://tiger-fish.github.io/web-dev-resources/) 

A website lisitng the resources I found for web development. Due to information overload, I decided to shrink the resources down to ones I personally use. 

## Resources
 * [MilanAryal/web-development-resources](https://github.com/MilanAryal/web-development-resources) | Where I got most of my resources. Check it out for more web dev resources.
 * [Vincenius/link-list](https://github.com/Vincenius/link-list) | List of Design Tools
 * [bradtraversy/design-resources-for-developers](https://github.com/bradtraversy/design-resources-for-developers) | Curated list of design and UI resources from stock photos, web templates, CSS frameworks, UI libraries, tools and much more
