## Introduction

A website lisitng the resources I found for web development. Due to information overload, I decided to shrink the resources down to ones I personally use. 

## Features to include
 * Hamburger Menu and hidden TOC when in Mobile
 * Texture Background
 * Checklist and Print
 * Scroll to Top Button
 * Bootstrap Collapse Cards
 * Add effects to each card (flip, hover, collapse sideways)
 * Favicon Grabber Api for Links
 * Dark Mode

## Problems to Overcome
